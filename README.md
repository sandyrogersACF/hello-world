# hello-world
This is a repository for a tutorial to learn GitHub.
Node.js and Coffeescript are new platforms I would like to make use of at some point in my programming career. I
am attempting to gain skills necessary to use my brain cells.
What happens if I forget to comment on my commit? Is the commit just random?
